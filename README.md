# Snake Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating the food that appears randomly on the screen.
